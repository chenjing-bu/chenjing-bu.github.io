A selected list of software that I have worked on.

## Banana Space

**Banana Space**
([香蕉空间](https://www.bananaspace.org/))
is an online mathematics wiki in Chinese,
similar to the [*n*Lab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage).
One of its aims is to encourage mathematical writing in Chinese.

Banana Space has its own dedicated typesetting language,
[btex](https://github.com/banana-space/btex).
It is similar to LaTeX,
but it produces web pages instead of PDFs.

## Lete Sans Math

[Lete Sans Math](https://github.com/abccsss/LeteSansMath)
is a sans-serif maths font based on the Lato font.
It can be used with XeLaTeX and the `unicode-math` package.

## nvim-gitstatus

[nvim-gitstatus](https://github.com/abccsss/nvim-gitstatus)
is a simple
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
plugin providing a
[lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim)
component for displaying git status in the status line.
