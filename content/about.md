## About me

I am a mathematics PhD student at the University of Oxford,
working with [Dominic Joyce](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/joyce/).

## About this site

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
and uses a modification of the [Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme.
The fonts used are [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)
and [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com/).
Mathematical formulae are rendered with
[KaTeX](https://katex.org/),
with mathematical symbols set in Inter and
[Lete Sans Math](https://github.com/abccsss/LeteSansMath).

The source code of this site is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/chenjing-bu/chenjing-bu.github.io).
